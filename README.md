## UMD Mod Template
This repository is a collection of scripts to make editing Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Conviction/Blacklist files as straightforward as possible. It automates the unpacking and repacking of umds so you can simply edit whatever config files you like, build the file and run.
***
### Requirements
The file manipulation is done in Python, so you'll need to have Python 3 installed and added to your PATH variable. 

This repository contains no game files, and contains .gitignores to keep it free of copyrighted material, so you will need a copy of the game to pull files from. Steam and Uplay versions are both ok.

You will also need [Gildor's unumd](https://www.gildor.org/smf/index.php/topic,458.msg15196.html#msg15196) for the initial unpacking of the compressed umd. Place unumd.exe in the 'Tools' folder.

### Getting Started
You'll want to start with a clean install of your game with no files modified. Clone this repo or [download it as a .zip](https://github.com/wcolding/UMDModTemplate/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).  

First, put the umd you want to modify into the 'UMD' folder. Only the first found umd file will be extracted, so I recommend creating different instances of this template for different umds you might want to mod. Edit `settings.py` in a text editor or IDE and change umdName to the name of your umd (keeping the quotes). Change game to the appropriate value. Possible values are `Game.Conviction` or `Game.Blacklist`.

Run `python unpack.py` in Windows PowerShell or cmd. This script will put all the extracted files in a 'src' folder. It will also generate a file called `manifest.txt`. This file contains the name, offset, size and an md5 hash of files in the 'src' folder. This information is important for patching 'Uncompressed.umd' and creating a final modded umd in the build folder. **DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE.**

Then you are free to edit files in 'src'. When you're ready to build it, run `python pack.py` in PowerShell or cmd. The resulting file will be in the 'Build' folder.

### Additional Notes
You want to make sure that each file stays the same size. If you switch a "false" to a "true", you should make sure to add another character to a comment somewhere. If `tryResizeFiles` in `settings.py` is True, the pack script will attempt to pad/trim files that fail to match the specified size in `manifest.txt`. If this setting is False, the file will simply not be added if it is the wrong size.

Not all files can be patched. Most of the Unreal Engine formatted assets in Conviction.umd require another layer of compression. You might notice that the contents of 'src' are a lot larger than the uncompressed UMDs. These tools do not currently support repacking such files. To see which files can be repacked, check `manifest.txt`. Any files with -1 after the name could not be matched to an offset within Uncompressed.umd. If the setting `useOptimizedManifest` in `settings.py` is True, the manifest will not contain any such files and the pack script will not check them for changes.
